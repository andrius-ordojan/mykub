# Mykub

My customized version of [Omakub](https://omakub.org) for my personal use. Mostly removed some things and added others. Keeping the structure of the original project.

I like to keep my dotfiles in a seperate repository and soft link them. I share them between computers so didn't add them here.

# Installation
```bash
eval "$(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrius-ordojan/mykub/main/boot.sh)"
```
